# Discord-Alternatives

As of recent Discord controversy, many users seek to find a replacement for discord.  
Here is somewhat a quick list you can find on the web, that would help you to get familiar with options.  

These alternatives are still in very early alpha development, and does need time so they do lack many features.  
As time goes on, you want to use the one that doesn't slow and stagnate development  
and doesn't take the same trajectory as discord did.  

Tip, you don't have to abandon discord  
Just start by inviting your friends
