# Discord-Alternatives

As of recent Discord controversy many users seek to find a replacement for discord.
Here is somewhat a quick list you can find on the web, that would help you to get familiar with options.
Some alternatives are still in early development, so they do lack features.
As time goes on, you want to use the one that doesn't slow and stagnate development
and doesn't make the same trajectory as discord did.
